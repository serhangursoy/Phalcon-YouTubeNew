# Phalcon - YouTube New - A redesign project for YouTube!

Hello,
I made this simple project to learn Phalcon Framework. Frankly, I'm amazed with the ligthning-bolt speed of Phalcon.
I tried to keep it simple as possible. Just browse around Models and Views. You will grasp the logic easily. With any questions or Issues, don't hesitate to contact with me!

I used Material Theme from Creative-Tim, I, obviously, modified that a lot how ever it is still an outstanding work according to me. Don't hesitate to check their page as well
